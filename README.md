# Organic-Growth

Here are some steps on how to organically grow your Discord Bot.

1) Make good product that will satisfy people's needs in their Discord Servers.

2) Let's say that you have made your good product, now let's grow it, start talking about and bring people's attention around your bot, tell them what it does, and if they like it, they may invite it to their servers and if it is actually good they may recommend it to others ( that's better way to grow a bot instead of straight going to top.gg or other bot lists to advertise it, and is fully organic growth)

**Do note that Bot lists won't prevent your bot from being verified, but I'd suggest to you to not advertise until after you're verified.**

To not get manually rejected due to inorganic growth by Discord your bot should not be in ghost servers, bot farms and should be in active use, make sure it doesn't have too many shared ownerships too

How would you track that, well you can implement logging system in a private channel and log guild joins and leave them if they're sus guilds.
